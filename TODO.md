# Order Service Fix - TODO List

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Fix populate path in `getOrdersByUser()` function: change `orderItem.product` to `orderItem.productId`
- [x] Fix populate path in `getOrdersById()` function: change `orderItem.product` to `orderItem.productId`
- [x] Fix user field reference: change `user` to `userId` in populate calls
- [x] Add missing return statements in `getOrdersByUser()` and `getOrdersById()` functions
- [x] Fix payment function customer data mapping
- [x] Test the fix by running the application

## Current Status:
- [x] Identified the root cause of StrictPopulateError
- [x] Analyzed schema structure and populate paths
- [x] Created comprehensive fix plan
- [x] Implement the fixes
- [x] Fixed additional payment-related issues
- [x] Application running successfully

## Changes Made:
### Original StrictPopulateError Fix:
- Fixed `getOrdersByUser()`: Changed `orderItem.product` to `orderItem.productId` and `user` to `userId`
- Fixed `getOrdersById()`: Changed `orderItem.product` to `orderItem.productId` and `user` to `userId`
- Added missing return statements in both functions
- Cleaned up formatting issues (removed stray backticks)

### Additional Payment Fix:
- Fixed `orderPayment()` function: Changed `order.user` to `order.userId` and properly mapped customer data
- Mapped `order.userId.email` to `customer.mail` to match payment utility expectations
- Structured customer object with proper name, mail, and phone fields

## Issues Resolved:
1. ✅ StrictPopulateError: Cannot populate path `orderItem.product`
2. ✅ TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') in payment function
